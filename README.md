# 🚀 AI Dev Agent — Local AI-Powered Developer Assistant (Ollama)

---

# 🧠 Project Overview

AI Dev Agent is a command-line based intelligent assistant designed to simulate a **Senior DevOps Engineer**, powered entirely by **local Large Language Models using Ollama**.

It can:
- Answer technical questions  
- Debug errors  
- Analyze code/files  
- Guide DevOps workflows  

👉 This project demonstrates how to build a **real AI Agent using local LLMs**, without relying on external APIs.

---

# 🎯 Objective of the Project

The goal of this project is to:

- Build a real AI agent using local LLMs  
- Understand AI agent architecture  
- Integrate tools with LLMs  
- Create a cost-free, offline AI system  
- Develop a strong AI + DevOps portfolio project

# 🏗️ Architecture & Flow of Execution

## 🔁 High-Level Flow

User Input → Command Processing → Tool / LLM → Response Generation → Output

---

## 🔍 Detailed Execution Flow

1. **User Input**
   - User enters command in terminal
   - Example: `ask`, `explain error`, `read file`

2. **Command Detection**
   - The agent identifies the command

3. **Decision Layer**
   - If tool-based command → execute tool  
   - Else → send input to LLM  

4. **Tool Execution (if applicable)**
   - File Reader → Reads file content  
   - Error Explainer → Formats debugging prompt  

5. **Prompt Construction**
   - Combines:
     - System prompt (developer personality)
     - User input
     - Tool output

6. **LLM Processing (Ollama)**
   - Local model (e.g., llama3) processes request

7. **Response Output**
   - Printed in terminal using formatted output

# ⚙️ Internal Working

The system is built using:

- Python (Core logic)
- LangChain (LLM abstraction)
- Ollama (Local LLM runtime)
- Custom Tools (Actions)
- Prompt Engineering (Behavior control)

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. LLM (Local Brain)
Handled by Ollama using models like:
- llama3
- mistral
- phi3

### 2. Tools Layer
- Error Explainer Tool
- File Reader Tool

### 3. Prompt System
Defines how the agent behaves like a senior developer

### 4. CLI Interface
Handles user interaction via terminal
